# phpseclib - PHP Secure Communications Library - CAdES CMS edition

This is a fork of phpseclib with changes specific for creating and validating CMS / PKCS7 messages with both regular signatures and CAdBES compliant signatures.

CAdES / CMS support was made possible by a donation from GLOBO (globogis.it)

I intend to incorporate this into phpseclib at some point in the future but right now my phpseclib priorities are elsewhere. I can re-arrange my priorities for a price - $100 / hr. That's how much support requests or new feature requests will cost. Send an email to terrafrost@php.net if this is something you're interested in. Otherwise, hopefully you'll find this easy to use.

A few examples live in the demo/ directory.
